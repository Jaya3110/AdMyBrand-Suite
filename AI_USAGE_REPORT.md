```
"Create a responsive React dashboard component with glass morphism effects, 
gradient backgrounds, and smooth animations using Framer Motion. Include 
TypeScript interfaces and make it mobile-first with TailwindCSS."
```

3.2. AI Chatbot Implementation
```
Prompt:

"Build a floating chatbot widget for a SaaS landing page using React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion. The chatbot helps users with pricing questions, feature info, and general support.

âœ¨ UI/UX Requirements:
Floating circular chat icon fixed at bottom-right with hover animation.
On click, open a chat window/modal with glassmorphism styling (backdrop blur, subtle shadows, rounded corners).
Use Framer Motion for smooth open/close animation (scale + fade).
Chat window includes:
Welcome message from AI assistant
Input field with send button
Chat history area with differentiated user vs bot messages
Scrollable and mobile responsive
Close button on top-right corner of chat window.

âš¡ Functional Requirements:
Toggle open/close chatbot modal on icon click.
Maintain chat history in state (React useState/useReducer).
Placeholder bot responses (can be integrated with OpenAI API later).
Optional: Auto-scroll to latest message.

ðŸŽ¨ Style Details:
Tailwind CSS with support for dark mode.
Use modern icon for chatbot (e.g., message or AI bot icon from Lucide or Heroicons).
Add hover/press animation on floating icon using Framer Motion.
Output the full component code in React + TypeScript with styling, animation, and placeholder bot logic."
```

3.3. Pricing Calculator
```
Prompt:

"Build a modern, interactive pricing calculator for a SaaS landing page using React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion. Users can:
Adjust the number of team members (slider or numeric input).
Choose a usage tier (Starter, Pro, Enterprise) via toggle or buttons.
See live total cost update with smooth animation.

âœ¨ UI/UX Requirements:
Apply glassmorphism styling with shadows, backdrop blur, and subtle gradients.
Add Framer Motion animations for element entrance and cost change transitions.
Mobile-first responsive layout with clear typography.
Include optional discount toggle (e.g., yearly/monthly switch).
Support dark mode using Tailwind dark classes.

ðŸ“ˆ Functional Requirements:
Total cost = (base price of tier + per user cost Ã— team size).
Live update on user input with animated number counter.
Validate min/max team size (e.g., 1-100).
Output a complete component in React with TypeScript types and Tailwind classes."

```
